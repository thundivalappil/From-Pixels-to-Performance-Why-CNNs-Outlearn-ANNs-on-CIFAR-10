# From-Pixels-to-Performance-Why-CNNs-Outlearn-ANNs-on-CIFAR-10
This project demonstrates the learning gap between a baseline ANN and a deep CNN on CIFAR-10. Using identical data pipelines, it highlights how convolution, normalization, and regularization enable CNNs to extract spatial features, converge better, and significantly outperform dense networks on image data.
